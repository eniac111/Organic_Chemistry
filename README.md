# Учебни материали по Органична Химия

A small PDF that I found in one of my backups from the High School.

I can say that my whole class was blackmailed by the teacher in the highschool. We had to digitalize his hand written notebook to get our exams. Also, he didn't teach us anything for the whole year.
This is hand typing work of ~25 teens. That's why it should be public. 50% of the chemistry formulas were my own work.

## The book is in Bulgarian.
